# Random-Quote-Generator
Full Stack Javascript-Team Treehouse Techdegree Project 1

This is my first project for the Team Treehouse Techdegree (Full Stack Javascript)
It's a random quote generator

Features include:
Random quote generated upon clicking on button
Random color generated after each click of the button
Alternatively, it is self timed after 15 seconds to run the program changing the bacground color
and providing a new quote
Quotes do not repeat until it has cycled through each of over 10+ quotes
